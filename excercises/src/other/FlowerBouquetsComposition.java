/***
 * Your website "The Bouquet of the Week" is a huge hit. Each week you sell only
 * one type of bouquet consisting of flowers of 4 colors: purple, red, yellow and
 * orange. This simplifies logistics a lot. To avoid that your customers get bored,
 * you change the composition of the bouquet each week by varying the number of
 * flowers of each color.
 * You receive daily quantities of each flowers that correspond more or less to what you ordered.
 * In general, in the evening, there are flowers of some colors that have not been used for the dayâ€™s
 * bouquets that can be reused the next day. But beware, they fade after 48 hours
 * so it is not possible to reuse them two days later.
 * You must determine the maximum number of bouquets achievable in a week
 * based on daily arrivals.
 * Data
 * Input
 * Row 1: four integers P, R, Y and O between 1 and 50, separated by a space,
 * respectively corresponding to the number of flowers of the type purple, red,
 * yellow and orange which will compose the bouquet of the week.
 * Rows 2 to 8: four integers P, R, Y and O between 1 and 1000, separated by a
 * space, respectively corresponding to the number of flowers of the type purple,
 * red, yellow and orange delivered on the 7 consecutives days of the week.
 * Output
 * An integer corresponding to the maximum number of bouquets achievable during the week.
